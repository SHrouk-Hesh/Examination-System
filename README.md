# Examination-System

##### Introducing Examination System, an object-oriented programming (OOP) project tailored to streamline the assessment process. Designed with efficiency and flexibility in mind, the system allows administrators to create and manage exams, while providing students with an intuitive interface for taking tests. Leveraging OOP principles, our project offers modular design and extensibility, making it easy to add new features and adapt to changing requirements. With features such as random question generation, time limits, and result tracking, our Examination System ensures fair and accurate evaluations. Join our journey in revolutionizing the way exams are conducted with the power of OOP.
